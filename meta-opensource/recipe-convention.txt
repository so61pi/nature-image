- _append, _prepend should be preferred to +=, =+, ...
- Strings after _append, _prepend must have
  both a leading and a trailing space unless
  there are reasons for not to.
- Strings after +=, =+, ... should also have
  both a leading and a trailing space unless
  there are reasons for not to.

For example
    RDEPENDS_${PN}_append = " util-linux-agetty "
    RDEPENDS_${PN} += " util-linux-login "
